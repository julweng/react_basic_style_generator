# ColoText
ColoText is a front-end project made with ReactJS that allows users to choose a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com), text color and background color.

Unlike existing font or color generator, this app combines the functions of both. Users are presented with the ease to compare two font and color selections by having two windows side by side.

## What does the app do
The app currently provides users with the following functions:
1. Select a google font
2. Select a font style (thin, light, bold, regular, italic, etc.)
3. Select a color for the text
4. Select a background color

## How to use
1. git clone the repo
2. cd into the local folder
3. `yarn start` to view the app locally
4. run tests by `yarn test`
